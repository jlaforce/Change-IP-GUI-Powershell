I threw up a new website, if you like this script, like any of my blog stuff, please share. 
I'm in the market for a new home, a new challenge, a new place to automate.
So you can help a brother out by sharing some of this content, the sites content, or just the site itself. 
I would super preeeesh, and it would help me out a lot. 
Or if you want me to look at any of your work, or help troubleshoot, let me know! ::I'll remove any mention of ya, unless you are cool with me blogging about it. If that's ok, I'll let you review before you post it. Just let me know how to mention or "holla back" at ya.::
